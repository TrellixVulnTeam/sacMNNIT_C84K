                    <h2>
                    FROM PRESIDENT DESK

                    Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad has been known for its excellence,
academically, and the students keep raising the bar for themselves by proving to be a step ahead
of the crowd, time and again. The institute, at the same time, also has records of achievements in
curricular as well as extra-curricular activities. An extremely crucial role is played by the Student
Activity Centre (SAC) of the institute in facilitating the activities and reaching out to the
students. The prime locations of the SAC are Students’ Clubs, Boys’ SAC and Girls’ SAC,
Multipurpose Hall, Athletics Ground and Gymkhana. The student activity center hires pool of
part-time coaches for various events on yearly basis to groom the talents of the students.<br>
The Institute provides ample avenues for the development and nurturing of creative and other
talents in the students through the Student Activity Centre (SAC). All the activities are managed
by students under the guidance of President, SAC and a team of Faculty In-Charges, Faculty
Coordinators and Committees for various events. The SAC provide avenues for Cultural,
Technical and Managerial events, Personality development, Atheletics, Indoor and Outdoor
games, Yoga and other activities. The SAC also facilitate and encourage the students to take part
in similar events in other institutions.
I encourage all the students to take part and actively involve in at least one of the event of the
SAC.<br>
I wish a very bright and sporty career to all the MNNIT students.<br>
